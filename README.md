this hack is for purly education reasons and the Devs are not responsibale for anything.


                                                         HOW TO USE:
To use this hack copy and paste the code provided in you're console before going into a lesson ("iready.com") and the menu should work! if it does not work an alert should pop up saying its down or not working :( .You can also use it as a bookmark so you don't have to copy and paste every time to do this simply bookmark any website (click the star in the top right) and click edit then type "javascript:" (without the quotation marks) and paste the code!
